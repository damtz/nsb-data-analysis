# House Rent Price Prediction :houses:
###### Urbanization has become very common in developing as well as developed countries whereby people migrate from rural to urban areas in search of brighter social as well as economic feasibility such as better education, good health care, proper sanitation, comfortable housing, immense business opportunities and versatile transportation.However, there are problems associated with urbanization. One of them is finding a place to live in. With the increase in the number of people moving from rural to urban, people are having a difficult time finding an affordable place to live in. Taking advantage of the situation, house owners are increasing the house rent and people, in their desperation, have no choice but to stay in houses with rents that are above their pay grade. In order to prevent people from being scammed, there is a need for a system which can predict the rent of houses based on features which can help people know the approved rent of houses.
